ALX Simple Shell Project

## Simple Shell

This is a simple UNIX command line interpreter developed as part of the ALX School Software Engineering program. The project is designed to help participants reinforce their understanding of fundamental programming concepts and the basics of the C programming language.

## Project Overview

The Simple Shell project aims to create a basic command line shell that can interpret and execute simple commands. It covers various aspects of UNIX systems, including process creation, environment variables, and command execution.

## Getting Started

To compile the shell, use the provided Makefile with the following command:

```bash
$ make
```

Run the shell interactively by executing:
```bash
$ ./hsh
```


The shell supports various built-in commands, logical operators, and file input. Refer to the project description for a detailed list of features and requirements.
